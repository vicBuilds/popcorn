# Getting Started with Create React App

Commands:
1. git clone --single-branch -b `branch-name(you can give any name without the bacticks offcourse)` 'repo-link(`https://github.com/vicBuilds/react-starter.git` .(add a dot at the end to add the files directly inside the folder without another folder)'
2. npm install to install all the dependencies because the git repo is without the node_modules

Get Started and get going...
